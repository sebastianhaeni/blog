named “AI Seminar”. In this course, each student is expected to read a paper of their choice.
We will go through understanding writing style, understanding content, reviewing and criticizing
a paper, evaluating yourself oneself and have a final presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My selection of the paper is &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00031305.2017.1380080&quot;&gt;Forecasting at Scale, by Sean J. Taylor &amp;#x26; Benjamin Letham&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why I have chosen this seminar&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have not touched on that many results of scientific work. This course is ideal to fix that for me.
We will discuss in person and work through a paper in depth. I feel like this is something that will
always be handy to have experienced regarding my future career, even if I would never write a paper.
But since I’m inscribed in this seminar, I may even would feel comfortable writing a paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That the papers we read are supposed to be in the field of AI is also something adding to my
motivation to choose this seminar as my specialization is Data Science. Meaning I can learn about
some AI methods that I am interested in anyway. So, two flies with one clap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My learning goals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My learning goals pretty much align with the course description. So I want to learn about scientific
writing, what a good paper is about and get familiar with a topic of my interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; in detail how the process of writing scientific papers is like and hear from an
expert that has experience in this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; criticizing a paper and get feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to &lt;em&gt;refine&lt;/em&gt; my writing skills.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to &lt;em&gt;get to know&lt;/em&gt; the method explained in my chosen paper in detail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to &lt;em&gt;establish&lt;/em&gt; a regular blogging habit beyond this seminar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I want to &lt;em&gt;share&lt;/em&gt; my learning process and gain insights how others do doing the same.&lt;/li&gt;

This post is the first ever post in a personal blog.
I try to explain why having a personal blog is a good idea IMHO and what gives me the motivation to
start it now. If you don’t have your own place to write, this maybe gives you some motivation to do
so too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Who am I&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m a software engineer working at a large telecommunications company in Switzerland. Here I build
large scale full stack web applications with technologies such as Springboot and Angular. We pursue
a modern development pipeline with state of the art tooling and automation with autonomous releasing
and advanced monitoring techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides that, I’m doing my Master of Science with specialization in Data Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I have lots of things I learn daily. Some things are personal ideas, some things are
implementations of ideas of the industry, some things are just personal reflection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation #1: Writing down what I learned&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you learn new things on a daily basis, you will eventually have learned that many relevant things
you are not able to recall each and every learning correctly unless you write it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you write it down for your personal use only, you can write down pretty much anything. It
could be confidential, it could be targeting people. This may work very well for you. But if there
is a greater learning, and you stay on the detail level about the problem, you may not be able to
generalize the learning to new problems and you have not thought enough about it to abstract the
problem and solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you write a blog that can be accesses publicly, you need to remove any confidential information
from it. What is left at that point is an abstract description of problem and solution that in
theory should be applicable to you in the future in a new setting. Because you’ll not always be
in the same environment forever and your problem and solution space changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also while you have go through the abstraction process you start to get to the core of you learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation #2: Sharing with others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might learn useful things that you share verbally, by email or text message, but with a blog you
can share what you learned with people you don’t know. They would probably reach a single article of
the blog through a Google search, read it and apply it to their problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is different to Stackoverflow or GitHub issues that you write about a problem you had with
your own motivation. You’re not solving somebodies problem that they posted and want an answer for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think that the blog post would be more of a guide to a larger problem with an introduction
and conclusion, several sections and references. It often is not just a few sentences and a code
snippet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By sharing the blog post publicly and including a discussion or comment section, you are able to
get feedback. This may be that you explained something not clearly or that there are other people
that have thought about this problem before that you don’t know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation #3: Refine my writing skills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Explaining something so everybody can understand is an essential skill for engineers working in
teams. If you want to introduce a new concept, raise awareness about architectural problems and so
on, not everybody will understand what you mean without investing time explaining it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By writing a blog, you are forced to explain complex settings in a clear way. I think the only real
way to get better at this, is to exercise it. So a blog can be an excellent tool to refine your
writing skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also my mother tongue is not English, so this blog allows me to refine my English writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation #4: Trying Gatsby.js&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m reading a lot of people are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/&quot;&gt;Gatsby.js&lt;/a&gt;. It sounds like a promising
technology and I am eager to get my hands on it. It has some cool concepts. So, I’m building this
blog with Gatsby.js.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/sebastianhaeni/blog&quot;&gt;https://github.com/sebastianhaeni/blog&lt;/a&gt;
if you want to read the source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Motivation #5: AI Seminar course&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, and where I finally got the motivation to start this blog is a seminar about AI that I’m
inscribed in for my Masters. In that course, we go through a scientific paper and are expected to
write blog posts about the process and what we learned when reading and asking questions about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
