Why am I starting to write my own starting? This post is the first ever post of my career in a blog. I try 
to explain why having a personal blog is a good idea IMHO and what gives me the motivation to start it now.

## Who am I?

I'm a software engineer working at a large telecommunications company in Switzerland. Here I build
large scale full stack applications as a day job. TODO

As I finished my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science in 2018 at Berner Fachhochschule, I was thinking this could
not have been it and I decided to start studying at University of Applied Sciences in Zurich (ZHAW) with specialization
in Data Science. TODO

## Motivation #1: Writing down what I learned
TODO

## Motivation #2: Sharing with others
TODO

## Motivation #3: Refine my writing skills
TODO

## Motivation #4: AI Seminar course at ZHAW
TODO
