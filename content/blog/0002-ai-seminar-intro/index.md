As mentioned in my first blog post [New Beginnings](/0001-new-beginnings), I'm inscribed to a course
named "AI Seminar". In this course, each student is expected to read a paper of their choice.
We will go through understanding writing style, understanding content, reviewing and criticizing
a paper, evaluating yourself oneself and have a final presentation.

## Why I have chosen this seminar

I have not touched on that many results of scientific work. This course is ideal to fix that for me.
We will discuss in person and work through a paper in depth. I feel like this is something that will
always be handy to have experienced regarding my future career, even if I would never write a paper.
But since I'm inscribed in this seminar, I may even would feel comfortable writing a paper.

That the papers we read are supposed to be in the field of AI is also something adding to my
motivation to choose this seminar as my specialization is Data Science. Meaning I can learn about
some AI methods that I am interested in anyway. So, two flies with one clap.

## My learning goals

My learning goals pretty much align with the course description. So I want to learn about scientific
writing, what a good paper is about and get familiar with a topic of my interest.

1. I want to _know_ in detail how the process of writing scientific papers is like and hear from an
   expert that has experience in this.
1. I want to _try_ criticizing a paper and get feedback.
1. I want to _refine_ my writing skills.
1. I want to _get to know_ the method explained in my chosen paper in detail.
1. I want to _establish_ a regular blogging habit beyond this seminar.
1. I want to _share_ my learning process and gain insights how others do doing the same.
