The second is people with expertise in the area the decision is being taken.</p>\n<p>[1] An architecturally significant decision is one that is hard to change later, has a significant impact on the system, and is not obvious. See <a href=\"/0014-architectural-significance\">Architectural Significance</a> for more.</p>\n<p>We are not looking for consensus here, but we are looking for a broad range of inputs and voices. Decision-takers are encouraged to specifically seek out those who will disagree with them.</p>\n<p>When deployed, decisions are better, faster, more accountable, and most importantly decisions which are understood and owned by those who implement them, precisely because the decision-taker is the one with the need as well as the one who is accountable.</p>\n<p>The traditional architect now plays the role of a Guide, drawing on their experience in the field.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[In order for an architecture to be successful] it is very much about ensuring that conversations that are needed to be happening are happening - not always initiating them, nor always helping to focus or navigate them, but ensuring they do happen […] and guiding when needed</p>\n<p>— <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20201222143814/https://www.ruthmalan.com/Journal/2016/2016JournalFebruary.htm#Still_Need_Architects\">Ruth Malan</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Also check out this excellent talk: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVyt3qQ_7TA\">Architecture without Architects - Erik Dörnenburg</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"the-four-supporting-elements\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-four-supporting-elements\" aria-label=\"the four supporting elements permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Four Supporting Elements</h2>\n<p>The Advice Process requires four elements to be implemented successfully:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a thinking and recording tool<br>→ Architectural Decision Records</li>\n<li>a time and place for conversations<br>→ Architecture Advisory Forum</li>\n<li>a light to illuminate and guide towards a unified direction<br>→ Team-sourced Architecture Principles</li>\n<li>a means to sense the current technical landscape and climate<br>→ Tech Radar</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative;
