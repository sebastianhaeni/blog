I want to <em>refine</em> my writing skills.</h3>\n<p>Writing blog posts for a broader audience definitely helped to refine my writing skills.\nEach time I dedicated a lot of thinking time into the structure of the post. My process was as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Lay out the structure of the post. The question I asked myself was, how should the reading journey be like? How do we\nstart and how do we end? What does the audience expect? I also did some research how similar posts are structured and\nif I can improve on that.</li>\n<li>Fill in the created sections with bullet points of what I want to write about. This helped me to understand at an\nearly stage if the flow of the post will make sense in the end. So here I also reviewed the structure again and made\nsome readjustments.</li>\n<li>On a different day, the next step would be to fill in the sections with prose text, images and references. While\nwriting, I often did research and looked for interesting graphics or references.</li>\n<li>My last step is proof-reading and ensuring the post forms a whole and sentences or paragraphs are not dangling.</li>\n<li>Publish</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I learned that reading the sentence that I wrote again on a different day usually gives me ideas on how to improve it to\nsupport the reading flow of the reader. I‚Äôm still having trouble to stay away from passive sentences though.</p>\n<p><a href=\"../0004-dissecting-paper-style\">Looking at the writing style</a> of the paper I read was also helpful, as I think\nit‚Äôs style was quite good, and I identified the parts that were not so good.</p>\n<p>üíØ goal fulfilled</p>\n<h3 id=\"4-i-want-to-get-to-know-the-method-explained-in-my-chosen-paper-in-detail\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#4-i-want-to-get-to-know-the-method-explained-in-my-chosen-paper-in-detail\" aria-label=\"4 i want to get to know the method explained in my chosen paper in detail permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4. I want to <em>get to know</em> the method explained in my chosen paper in detail.</h3>\n<p>I think now I understand the contents of the paper ‚ÄúForecasting at Scale‚Äù, because I not only did a skimming read, a\nthorough read and reading of surrounding literature, I also summarized it in a <a href=\"../0006-forecasting-at-scale-content\">blog post</a>\nand held a short presentation.</p>\n<p>One could look at this process of summarizing like an autoencoder. A summary should be shorter than what\nyou are trying to summarize, otherwise it‚Äôs not a summary. So somehow you have to make it shorter, and you do this by\ncompressing information down. The person reading the summary should still be able to grasp the content of the original\npaper with some slight imprecision when filling in the gaps in their own mind. That‚Äôs exactly what an autoencoder\narchitecture would accomplish as well. So the summarizing process is figuring out what parts have to be encoded into the\nsummary for a possible decoding to be successful.</p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 590px; \"\n    >\n      <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 74.32432432432432%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/png;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"autoencoder\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/blog/static/3f3761c6fd7d8a8683b8d75b8c0610b8/fcda8/autoencoder.png\"\n        srcset=\"/blog/static/3f3761c6fd7d8a8683b8d75b8c0610b8/12f09/autoencoder.png 148w,\n/blog/static/3f3761c6fd7d8a8683b8d75b8c0610b8/e4a3f/autoencoder.png 295w,\n/blog/static/3f3761c6fd7d8a8683b8d75b8c0610b8/fcda8/autoencoder.png 590w,\n/blog/static/3f3761c6fd7d8a8683b8d75b8c0610b8/efc66/autoencoder.png 885w,\n/blog/static/3f3761c6fd7d8a8683b8d75b8c0610b8/00d43/autoencoder.png 1000w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n        decoding=\"async\"\n      />\n    </span>\nImage Source: <a href=\"https://mc.ai/variational-autoencoders-an-intuitive-explanation-some-keras-code-2/\">mc.ai</a></p>\n<p>In turn I discovered the key points of the paper and internalized it for myself.</p>\n<p>üíØ goal fulfilled</p>\n<h3 id=\"5-i-want-to-establish-a-regular-blogging-habit-beyond-this-seminar\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#5-i-want-to-establish-a-regular-blogging-habit-beyond-this-seminar\" aria-label=\"5 i want to establish a regular blogging habit beyond this seminar permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>5.

As I plan to continue using this blog as my personal blog for the foreseeable future, I always had in mind\nwriting for a broader audience that is not exclusively limited to participants of the seminar. I was always impressed\nby what the others created and tried to learn from their good efforts and tried to improve upon. Unfortunately I\nalmost never published my posts very early, which is why my colleagues had little to no time to read it before our\nsessions. So I would give myself a negative rating for the timeliness, but an above-average rating for the content\nitself compared to others.</li>\n<li><strong>Session Participation</strong>: I came reasonably well prepared into the sessions, having read the emails and slides from\nlast time, the additional resources and the posts of the others. I enjoyed the sessions as they were focused and\nrequired one to be ‚Äúpresent‚Äù with their mind. I think all participants did well.</li>\n<li><strong>Presentations</strong>: The long-ish presentation is still ahead of me. The few things I presented were ok-ish. At one time\nI was confused as what to present, because we were asked to prepare to present the findings of our writing style\nanalysis and then in the session we were asked to present the content (without having thought about how to present it).\nI also think all participants did well in this regard.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"learnings-summary\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#learnings-summary\" aria-label=\"learnings summary permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Learnings Summary</h2>\n<p>So, I learned to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>read / understand a scientific paper</li>\n<li>obtain more information / do literature research</li>\n<li>put research in context (with respect to current state of the art in the field)</li>\n<li>form my own scientific opinion / judgement</li>\n<li>present scientific results in different ways (blog, orally, presentation, written document)</li>\n<li>engage in a scientific discussion, express my view, formulate criticism</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>I can highly recommend this seminar to any other fellow students that might be reading this blog, thinking about\nenrolling.
