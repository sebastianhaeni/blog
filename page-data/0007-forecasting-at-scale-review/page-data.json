This can for example be a certain conference or journal.\nSo, I‚Äôm going to pretend I‚Äôm reviewing this for an AI conference similar to IJCAI (which might not make sense to ever\nsubmit this paper there, but I‚Äôm getting there üòÑ).</p>\n<h3>My Scores</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Relevance: 5 / 10 ‚≠ê</li>\n<li>Significance: 5 / 10 ‚≠ê</li>\n<li>Originality: 1 / 10 ‚≠ê</li>\n<li>Technical Quality: 3 / 10 ‚≠ê</li>\n<li>Clarity and quality of writing: 8 / 10 ‚≠ê</li>\n<li>Scholarship, i.e. scientific context: 7 / 10 ‚≠ê</li>\n<li>Overall Score: 4 / 10 ‚≠ê</li>\n<li>Confidence on my assessment: 5 / 10 ‚≠ê</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>My Comments About The Paper:</h3>\n<h4>Summary</h4>\n<p>The paper ‚ÄúForecasting at Scale‚Äù is a well laid out paper giving an insight into methods and techniques used to process\nbusiness time series at scale, do forecasts with the analyst in the loop and automatically select models. The trend\nmodel incorporates dynamic growth rates and change points. The seasonality model is based on Fourier series. The\nauthors propose to use a method called Simulated Historical Forecasts (SHF) to automatically evaluate forecasts. The main\nfindings are a set of techniques to apply in a large corporation with analysts that might have their hands full of\nwork to optimize their workflow to produce accurate forecasts with only little intervention.</p>\n<p>The authors assembled their techniques from several previous work, and I think one that gives a great overview is\n<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207006000021?casa_token=1C2peihwTC4AAAAA:PvXUJamS81Jwy2zOLvC8-EZROor8Um7yyRumc8OD4mxKPGGsMYvMHeVn6ghObfztwOFY93Uu\">‚Äú25 Years of Time Series Forecasting‚Äù</a>\nwhich is also referenced by the paper. I regard the significance and novelty as rather low and think the authors\nproduced a good confirmatory paper showcasing how these techniques work at scale.</p>\n<p>The authors explained their chosen methods well, they make sense and offer what is promised. A reader gains a good feel\nto build a forecasting system that can work at scale.</p>\n<p>What I‚Äôm missing in the paper are verification results of the chosen methods and how they would fare against other or\neven similar methods. Sometimes the authors also don‚Äôt explain their choices.</p>\n<p>I greatly appreciate the accompanying Python and R forecasting library <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/prophet/\">Prophet</a>\nthat has all mentioned methods implemented and is super fun to use. The paper is a good introduction for users of the\nlibrary.</p>\n<h4>Major Issues</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>As mentioned in the summary, comprehensible verification of the chosen trend and seasonality methods is largely missing.</li>\n<li>This paper is confirmatory of previous work and thus belongs into a journal rather than to a conference.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Minor Issues</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Table 1 is superfluous. The description of holidays and their format is enough.</li>\n<li>The style of figures should be consistent throughout the paper.</li>\n<li>The remark that the authors are storing SHF in Hive or MySQL can be helpful but feels out of place. Either it should\njust be more of a focus to describe implementation details or leave them away completely.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Confidential Notes to Editor</h4>\n<p>Since this is not a real review and there‚Äôs no reviewer I will not write any notes here, but still include it so it‚Äôs\nclear a review usually includes this section.</p>\n<p>One could mention that paper could be suspect to plagiarism or comments that the authors maybe didn‚Äôt know enough about\nprevious work. If you are making a borderline decision you can also add some comments to make the score distinguishable\nto the editor. And, if you have confidential information that you would not like the authors to know, you can add it.\nThis can for example be collected data that only your or your organization have and so on.</p>\n<p>If you have a conflict of interest you should not even start the review and make it clear beforehand.</p>\n<p><br><br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Review Template</h2>\n<p>The score categories I used above are explained here. The explanations are taken from the slide deck we received at my\nuniversity ZHAW.</p>\n<h3>Relevance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the paper fully within the scope of the conference?</li>\n<li>Will the questions and results of the paper be of interest to researchers in the field?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Significance</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Is this a significant advance in the state of the art?</li>\n<li>Is this a paper that people are likely to read and cite?</li>\n<li>Does the paper address an important problem?</li>\n<li>Does it open new research directions?</li>\n<li>Is it a paper that is likely to have a lasting impact?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Originality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Reviewers should recognise and reward papers that propose genuinely new ideas.</li>\n<li>As a reviewer you should try to assess whether the ideas are truly new.</li>\n<li>Novel combinations, adaptations or extensions of existing ideas are also valuable.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Technical Quality</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Are the results technically sound?</li>\n<li>Are there obvious flaws in the conceptual approach?</li>\n<li>Are claims well-supported by theoretical analysis or experimental results?</li>\n<li>Are the experiments well thought out and convincing?</li>\n<li>Will it be possible for other researchers to replicate these results?</li>\n<li>Is the evaluation appropriate?</li>\n<li>Did the authors clearly assess both the strengths and weaknesses of their approach?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Clarity and quality of writing</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Is the paper clearly written?</li>\n<li>Is there a good use of examples and figures?</li>\n<li>Is it well organized?</li>\n<li>Are there problems with style and grammar?</li>\n<li>Are there issues with typos, formatting, references, etc.?</li>\n<li>It may be better to advise the authors to revise a paper and submit to a later conference, than to accept and publish\na poorly-written version. However, if the paper is likely to be accepted, please make suggestions to improve the\nclarity of the paper, and provide details of typos.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Scholarship, i.e. scientific context</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Does the paper situate the work with respect to the state of the art?</li>\n<li>Are relevant papers cited, discussed, and compared to the presented work?</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Overall Score</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>(10) This is best-paper material</li>\n<li>(9) An excellent paper, a very strong accept</li>\n<li>(8) A very good paper, a strong accept</li>\n<li>(7) A good paper, accept.</li>\n<li>(6) A good paper overall.
