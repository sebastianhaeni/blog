In this course, each student is expected to read a paper of their choice.\nWe will go through understanding writing style, understanding content, reviewing and criticizing\na paper, evaluating yourself oneself and have a final presentation.</p>\n<h2>Why I have chosen this seminar</h2>\n<p>I have not touched on that many results of scientific work. This course is ideal to fix that for me.\nWe will discuss in person and work through a paper in depth. I feel like this is something that will\nalways be handy to have experienced regarding my future career, even if I would never write a paper.\nBut since I’m inscribed in this seminar, I may even would feel comfortable writing a paper.</p>\n<p>That the papers we read are supposed to be in the field of AI is also something adding to my\nmotivation to choose this seminar as my specialization is Data Science. Meaning I can learn about\nsome AI methods that I am interested in anyway. So, two flies with one clap.</p>\n<h2>My learning goals</h2>\n<p>My learning goals pretty much align with the course description. So I want to learn about scientific\nwriting, what a good paper is about and get familiar with a topic of my interest.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I want to <em>know</em> in detail how the process of writing scientific papers is like and hear from an\nexpert that has experience in this.</li>\n<li>I want to <em>try</em> criticizing a paper and get feedback.</li>\n<li>I want to <em>refine</em> my writing skills.</li>\n<li>I want to <em>get to know</em> the method explained in my chosen paper in detail.</li>\n<li>I want to <em>establish</em> a regular blogging habit beyond this seminar.</li>\n<li>I want to <em>share</em> my learning process and gain insights how others do doing the same.</li>\n</ol>","fields":{"slug":"/0002-ai-seminar-intro/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"AI Seminar Intro","date":"March 08, 2020","description":null,"tags":["MSc","AI Seminar","ML"]}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/0002-ai-seminar-intro/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/0001-new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","tags":["opinion"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/0003-facebook-prophet-paper/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Facebook's Prophet and the paper","tags":["MSc","AI Seminar","ML","Prophet"]}}}}}
