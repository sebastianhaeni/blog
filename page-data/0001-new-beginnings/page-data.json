This post is the first ever post in a personal blog.\nI try to explain why having a personal blog is a good idea IMHO and what gives me the motivation to\nstart it now. If you don’t have your own place to write, this maybe gives you some motivation to do\nso too.</p>\n<h2>Who am I</h2>\n<p>I’m a software engineer working at a large telecommunications company in Switzerland. Here I build\nlarge scale full stack web applications with technologies such as Springboot and Angular. We pursue\na modern development pipeline with state of the art tooling and automation with autonomous releasing\nand advanced monitoring techniques.</p>\n<p>Besides that, I’m doing my Master of Science with specialization in Data Science.</p>\n<p>So I have lots of things I learn daily. Some things are personal ideas, some things are\nimplementations of ideas of the industry, some things are just personal reflection.</p>\n<h2>Motivation #1: Writing down what I learned</h2>\n<p>If you learn new things on a daily basis, you will eventually have learned that many relevant things\nyou are not able to recall each and every learning correctly unless you write it down.</p>\n<p>Now if you write it down for your personal use only, you can write down pretty much anything. It\ncould be confidential, it could be targeting people. This may work very well for you. But if there\nis a greater learning, and you stay on the detail level about the problem, you may not be able to\ngeneralize the learning to new problems and you have not thought enough about it to abstract the\nproblem and solution.</p>\n<p>If you write a blog that can be accesses publicly, you need to remove any confidential information\nfrom it. What is left at that point is an abstract description of problem and solution that in\ntheory should be applicable to you in the future in a new setting. Because you’ll not always be\nin the same environment forever and your problem and solution space changes.</p>\n<p>Also while you have go through the abstraction process you start to get to the core of you learning.</p>\n<h2>Motivation #2: Sharing with others</h2>\n<p>You might learn useful things that you share verbally, by email or text message, but with a blog you\ncan share what you learned with people you don’t know. They would probably reach a single article of\nthe blog through a Google search, read it and apply it to their problem.</p>\n<p>This is different to Stackoverflow or GitHub issues that you write about a problem you had with\nyour own motivation. You’re not solving somebodies problem that they posted and want an answer for.</p>\n<p>I also think that the blog post would be more of a guide to a larger problem with an introduction\nand conclusion, several sections and references. It often is not just a few sentences and a code\nsnippet.</p>\n<p>By sharing the blog post publicly and including a discussion or comment section, you are able to\nget feedback. This may be that you explained something not clearly or that there are other people\nthat have thought about this problem before that you don’t know about.</p>\n<h2>Motivation #3: Refine my writing skills</h2>\n<p>Explaining something so everybody can understand is an essential skill for engineers working in\nteams. If you want to introduce a new concept, raise awareness about architectural problems and so\non, not everybody will understand what you mean without investing time explaining it.</p>\n<p>By writing a blog, you are forced to explain complex settings in a clear way. I think the only real\nway to get better at this, is to exercise it. So a blog can be an excellent tool to refine your\nwriting skills.</p>\n<p>Also my mother tongue is not English, so this blog allows me to refine my English writing.</p>\n<h2>Motivation #4: Trying Gatsby.js</h2>\n<p>I’m reading a lot of people are using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/\">Gatsby.js</a>. It sounds like a promising\ntechnology and I am eager to get my hands on it. It has some cool concepts. So, I’m building this\nblog with Gatsby.js.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://github.com/sebastianhaeni/blog\">https://github.com/sebastianhaeni/blog</a>\nif you want to read the source code.</p>\n<h2>Motivation #5: AI Seminar course</h2>\n<p>Lastly, and where I finally got the motivation to start this blog is a seminar about AI that I’m\ninscribed in for my Masters. In that course, we go through a scientific paper and are expected to\nwrite blog posts about the process and what we learned when reading and asking questions about it.</p>","fields":{"slug":"/0001-new-beginnings/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"New Beginnings","date":"March 01, 2020","description":"Why am I starting my own blog?
